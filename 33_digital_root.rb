# Digital root

# The digital root (also repeated digital sum) of a
# non-negative integer is the (single digit) value
# obtained by an iterative process of summing digits,
# on each iteration using the result from the previous
# iteration to compute a digit sum.
# The process continues until a single-digit number is reached.

# For example, the digital root of 65,536 is 7,
# because 6 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 6 = 25 and 2 + 5 = 7.

# Your code should return the digital root of any positive
# number passed in.
# You can assume the argument given is an integer.
# Return -1 if any negative argument is provided.
